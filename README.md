# FlytBase-UAV-Coordination-System

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for the FlytBase UAV Systems Engineer Assessment 2025. It includes a coordination system for managing multiple drones in a 4x4 grid of 16 docks, ensuring safe and efficient operations. The solution features:

- **System Design Document**: Outlines a dynamic airspace management system with advanced safety mechanisms, priority rules, and operational procedures to prevent collisions and optimize throughput.
- **Ideal Systems and Tools Specification**: Specifies an advanced Air Traffic Control (ATC) system, pilot interfaces with AR overlays, and robust physical/digital infrastructure, leveraging technologies like LiDAR, mesh networks, and AI-driven optimization.
- **Validation and Testing Plan**: Details rigorous testing methodologies to validate safety, efficiency, and scalability, including scenario-based tests, edge cases, and iterative improvement processes.
- **Code Implementation**: Provides code for the central traffic management system, drone firmware, pilot interfaces, and infrastructure, implementing real-time tracking, path planning, conflict resolution, and communication protocols.

The solution addresses the challenges of intersecting flight paths in a confined airspace, balancing safety and operational efficiency. It is designed to be scalable and adaptable to future drone operations, with a focus on practical, near-future technologies.
